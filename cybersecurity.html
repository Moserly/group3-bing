The results of this study provide important recommendations, such as the need for regular audits, staff training, strengthening cross-sector cooperation, and a coordinated approach to improve the national cybersecurity framework. Thus, this study aims to support the development of a more resilient and responsive cybersecurity strategy to evolving threats.</p>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>With rapid digital transformation in Indonesia, a comprehensive cybersecurity framework is essential to protect sensitive data from cyber threats. The Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (Kominfo), which oversees communication and IT infrastructures, plays a crucial role in securing national data assets. Yet, recent data breaches have raised questions regarding the effectiveness of Kominfo's cybersecurity strategies. These incidents reveal critical vulnerabilities and highlight the urgent need for strengthened security protocols and cross-agency coordination (The Diplomat, 2024; iTnews Asia, 2024).</p>
            <P>For instance, in mid-2024, Indonesia’s National Data Center suffered a ransomware attack that disabled over 200 government agency services, disrupting public operations. This event underscores Indonesia's current gaps in cyber risk mitigation (iTnews Asia, 2024). Experts suggest that, although the Personal Data Protection Act (PDP Law) was introduced, inconsistent enforcement and a lack of centralized authority create major challenges in addressing evolving threats (The Diplomat, 2024).</P>
            <p>This is important to understanding and preventing data breaches is essential not only for safeguarding sensitive information but also for maintaining public trust. Data leaks can result in serious legal, financial, and reputational repercussions for organizations. When government, like Kominfo, experience security breaches, it risks undermining public confidence and could lead to intensified scrutiny regarding data protection efforts (The Diplomat, 2024; Jakarta Post, 2024).</p>
            <p>Strengthening National Cybersecurity: Examining incidents involving Kominfo offers critical lessons for enhancing Indonesia's cybersecurity framework. Such analysis can guide improvements to protect both government and civilian data, forming a foundation for more resilient national cybersecurity strategies. Establishing coordinated, proactive measures across agencies is crucial in adapting to increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, especially as Indonesia moves toward a more digitally integrated infrastructure (iTnews Asia, 2024).</p>

            <h2>Theoretical Background</h2>
            <p>Cyber Threat Landscape in Indonesia Recent studies indicate that Indonesia’s digital infrastructure is increasingly targeted by sophisticated cyberattacks, including ransomware, data breaches, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The Kominfo ransomware incident in 2024, executed by the Brain Cipher group, disrupted over 200 government services and exposed critical weaknesses in the country’s cybersecurity framework. This incident exemplifies the broader trend of escalating cyber threats in Indonesia, necessitating a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity (Abraham, 2024).</p>

            <h2>Method</h2>
            <p>This study uses a qualitative approach with a case study method to analyze data leakage incidents that occurred at the Ministry of Communication and Informatics (Kominfo). The methods used include the following stages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Literature Review: Reviewing literature, scientific journals, cybersecurity incident reports, and related regulations.</li>
                <li>Using descriptive analysis methods to evaluate the factors causing data leakage, such as weaknesses in information technology infrastructure, and lack of regulations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This method is designed to produce evidence-based recommendations, support the strengthening of cybersecurity in Indonesia, and ensure better data protection in the digital era.</p>

            <h2>Findings & Discussions</h2>
            <h3><strong>A. Understanding and Preventing Data Breaches</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Impact on Public Trust</li>
                    <p>Data breaches undermine public confidence, especially when they involve government entities like Kominfo. Such incidents expose vulnerabilities in critical systems, leading to skepticism about the government’s ability to protect sensitive information and ensure national security (The Diplomat, 2024; Jakarta Post, 2024).</p>
                <li>Legal, Financial, and Reputational Risks</li>
                    <p>Organizations face significant repercussions from data leaks. These include legal penalties for failing to meet data protection standards, financial losses from operational disruptions or ransom payments, and reputational damage that can erode stakeholder confidence over the long term.</p>
                <li>Scrutiny of Data Protection Efforts</li>
                    <p>High-profile breaches attract intensified oversight, prompting questions about the adequacy of existing cybersecurity policies. For Indonesia, incidents involving Kominfo emphasize the need for a robust regulatory framework to address evolving cyber threats and safeguard national interests.</p>
            </ul>
